## What
We will increase even further the distance between embeddings between MNIST and OpNet by, not only resetting the two last layers of MNISTnet1, but also the first of OpNet.
## Why
The idea here is to completely destroy the need for a number language. The MNISTnet and the OpNet no longer have a defined input/output language, they can define another if they wish. 

# Results
#### 1. Compare the original ImageOpNet and the new one on the PairMNIST validation set

| Metric    | Base               | New                |
| --------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| Test Loss | 43.28394317626953  | 45.84989547729492  |
| Test MAE  | 1.8919484615325928 | 1.7345480918884277 |



#### 2. Compare the original MNIST1 and the MNIST1 extracted from the new ImageOpNet on the MNIST validation set

| Metric    | Base Network        | New Network            |
| --------- | ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Test Loss | 0.16023200750350952 | **203.59381103515625** |
| Test MAE  | 0.10831695795059204 | **9.499552726745605**  |
After inspection, the min and max value decoded by MNISTnet1 during testing is -55 and 21.

#### 3. Compare the original OpNet and the OpNet extracted from the new ImageOpNet
**Grey**: experiment 1.1.
**Blue**: experiment 1.2.
**Purple**: experiment 1.3.

# Discussion
The results are very interesting.
In terms of the final goal, the PairMNIST, it did on the same level as the previous experiments (actually, a bit better in MAE, but a worse in validation loss).

The interesting part is the results of the second section of results. As we can see, the MNISnet has been destroyed. It can not decode numbers. In fact the average error is almost as big as the range of possible numbers. The manual inspection revealed that values were between -55 and 21, very different from 0 and 9 as in MNIST.  

The conclusion from this is that it is possible for two fragments to create their own language between each other in order to communicate with one another.

I think we are ready to move towards the next question.
