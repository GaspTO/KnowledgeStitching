# Overview
## What
1) Train the function
2) Assess what happens when validate by cutting the stitching connections
3) Compare with similar NN trained without stitched fragment



# Results

#### 1. Compare StitchedOpNet with and without pre-trained fragment
Best checkpoint:

| Metric    | Pre-trained fragment | Untrained fragment   |
| --------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Test Loss | 0.00108454586006701  | 0.002321721753105521 |
| Test MAE  | 0.024771930649876595 | 0.03170658275485039  |

The following graphs where white is the pre-trained fragment and the green is the untrained
